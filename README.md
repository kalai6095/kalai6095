ðŸ’¬ About Me ...
As an experienced Java full stack developer with 8.5 years of industry experience, I have developed a strong proficiency in designing and developing scalable, high-performance applications. I have a deep understanding of core Java concepts, including Spring framework, Hibernate, and RESTful APIs. My technical skill set also includes expertise in front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as popular front-end frameworks such as Angular and React.

Throughout my career, I have been responsible for developing complex applications from scratch, as well as enhancing and maintaining existing applications. I have collaborated closely with cross-functional teams to understand business requirements and translate them into technical solutions. I have also played a key role in implementing best practices and ensuring code quality.

In addition to my technical expertise, I possess excellent communication and interpersonal skills that enable me to work effectively in team settings. I have a passion for learning and staying up-to-date with emerging technologies, and am always looking for ways to improve my skills and add value to the organization.
